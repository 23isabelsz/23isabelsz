    <p class="p">Hi, I'm Isabel Szerdy. I am an APCSP student and a junior at Piedmont High School. I am just finishing up the year before summer starts. I enjoy rock climbing and any other outdoor activities! Most of the time I can only climb at the gym, but any chance I get I head up to the mountains to climb outside. So far this year I have really enjoyed learning to code in html and javaScript.</p>
