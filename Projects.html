    <h2 class="p">Family Tree</h2>
    <p class="p">One project that I accomplished this year was an extensive family tree for my US History class. The tree goes all the way back to the 1600s in one areas. I learned alot about my family history and heritage through this project.</p>

    <h2 class="p">French Story</h2>
    <p class="p">Another project that I have accomplished is a fairy tale book that I made for my french class last year. It was a fully illustrated story book entirely in french. To submit the project, I made a video of me reading the story aloud. This project really helped my improve my french skills in both speaking and writing.</p>
